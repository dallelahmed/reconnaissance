# Reconnaissance
With the help of existing tools, I have created an automatic tool that can perform reconnaissance.
This involves fuzzing the website to extract all the subdomains and directories.
We then filter which ones are running and to which we have access.
Additionally, we use httporb to extract websites that are running.
Finally, I use Aquatone to take screenshots of the websites.
